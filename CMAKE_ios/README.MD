This folder contains the CMake build scripts for generating the RootHelper executable for iOS platform.
This is only for development/testing/experimentation purposes, in that a standalone iOS XFiles app
has not been developed (and probably will be never developed), and for running the binary from iOS
a jailbroken device and a terminal emulator app is needed.

For build instructions, please follow the main README file.
